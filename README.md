Use Python to sync your data to Salesforce.com

# Sync data between your dev sandboxes and production



# Sync data between different systems 

Syncing your data is a headache, and is often poorly done by 3rd party contractors.  

You can spend money on an intermediary solution (Like Boomi or Mulesoft).  They are great.

Alternatively, if you have no budget, try this instead.
